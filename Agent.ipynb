Burning fossil fuels like gasoline and diesel releases carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere. The buildup of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases like methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) is causing the Earth’s atmosphere to warm, resulting in changes to the climate we are already starting to see today. The effects of climate change are already impacting how we travel and damaging our infrastructure.

            "\" The logistics industry is a significant contributor to global carbon emissions, with estimates suggesting that it accounts for around 24% of global CO2e emissions. As such, there is a growing focus on the need for climate-neutral logistics solutions that can help reduce the sector's carbon footprint. The European Environment Agency has set a target of reducing global logistics emissions by 40% by 2050, and policymakers have established a global framework for responding to dangerous climate change.\\n\\nOne of the key challenges facing the logistics industry is the need to adapt to changing weather patterns and other climate-related risks. For example, extreme weather events such as floods, wildfires, and droughts can disrupt supply chains and make it difficult for companies to move goods around the world. To address these challenges, many companies are turning to integrated logistics solutions that can help them stay resilient in the face of climate change.\\n\\n\"\n",

Climate change poses significant risks to military effectiveness, including readiness, operations, and strategy. Readiness refers to the ability of a military to carry out operations in a timely manner, which can be compromised by climate change effects such as sea level rise and extreme weather events. Operations can also be impacted by climate change, whether they be war-fighting operations or humanitarian missions, with extreme droughts or flooding putting stresses on critical military infrastructure.\\n\\nThe logistics industry is a significant contributor to global carbon emissions, with estimates suggesting that it accounts for around 24% of global CO2e emissions. As such, there is a growing focus on the need for climate-neutral logistics solutions that can help reduce the sector's carbon footprint. The European Environment Agency has set a target of reducing global logistics emissions by 40% by 2050, and policymakers have established a global framework for responding to dangerous climate change.\\n\\nOne of the key challenges facing the logistics industry is the need to adapt to changing weather patterns and other climate-related risks. For example, extreme weather events such as floods, wildfires, and droughts can disrupt supply chains and make it difficult for companies to move goods around the world. To address these challenges, many companies are turning to integrated logistics solutions that can help them stay resilient in the face of climate change.\\n\\nThe transportation sector is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, accounting for about 29 percent of total U.S. GHG emissions. EPA is addressing climate change by taking the following actions to reduce GHG emissions from the transportation sector. Many of these programs have benefits beyond cutting carbon. Burning fossil fuels like gasoline and dies\"\n"
